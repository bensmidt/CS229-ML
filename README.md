# CS229-ML-Autumn-2018
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html), taught by Andrew Ng (Fall 2018).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). 

## Lectures Notes
My annotations of the class lecture notes can be found [here](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/AnnotatedLecNotes/Supervised)

My personal lecture notes are too large to store on GitHub so you can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HR9ji_F64mLXg3i-ZzgLo7budN3ESA65/view?usp=sharing) on my Google Drive (Note that this file is too large to view in Google Drive so you'll have to use a third party service such as Lumin or download it to your computer).

## Problem Sets
The problem set assignments (instructions) can be found [here](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/Problem-Sets). All coding assignments are programmed in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib. 

Problem sets contain roughly equal parts coding and mathematics. Each problem set contains a directory in [Solutions](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/Solutions) with my solutions for each problem. For simplicity I've decided to use Google Drive to store my handwritten math solutions since it automatically syncs with GoodNotes (however I may later upload a pdf for each problem set to GitHub since the solution are concise).
