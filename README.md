# CS229-ML-Autumn-2018
My solutions to Stanford's public course [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html), taught by Andrew Ng (Fall 2018).
Lectures are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU). 

# About Me
I am a 3rd year at the University of Texas at Austin (hook'em!) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering and Math. I'm the CTO of [Clips](https://www.clipsai.com/) (checkout the link for more information!) which heavily utilizes machine learning, specifically deep learning and natural language processing. I've decided to complete this course (as well as other public courses [EECS498/CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://github.com/bensmidt/EECS-498-DL-Computer-Vision) and CS224N: Deep Learning with Natural Language Processing) to gain the required knowledge in Machine Learning and Deep Learning to be able to properly build the models we're using at Clips. 

You can find out more about me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-smidt/). If you have any questions about my solutions, learning machine learning, or just want connect, feel free to follow me and reach out on LinkedIn. I can be a little slow to respond depending my current responsiblities but I can assure you I will respond! I hope you enjoy this course as much as I have and that my solutions are helpful :)

Last thing, big thank you to Stanford for making these lectures and course material publically available! They are immensely helpful and provide amazing opportunity to learn from many of the best minds in computer science (and other fields). They've been vital in my machine learning journey. 

## Lecture Notes

My annotation of the class lecture notes and my personal notes of the lecture videos are too large to store on GitHub so you can find view them using my Google Drive.
You can find my annotations of the class lecture notes [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ae0qp0J5v_XgKXwF4NZrAqLcA3rztSqZ?usp=sharing) and my personal lecture notes [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HR9ji_F64mLXg3i-ZzgLo7budN3ESA65/view?usp=sharing) on my Google Drive (Note that this file is likely too large to view in Google Drive so you'll have to use a third party service such as Lumin or download it to your computer).

## Problem Sets
There are a total of 4 problem sets, each with about 5 problems. Problem set assignments (instructions) along with the given starter code can be found in [Problem-Sets](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/Problem-Sets). All coding assignments are programmed in Python using NumPy and Matplotlib. 

Problem sets contain roughly equal parts coding and mathematics. Each problem set contains a directory in [Solutions](https://github.com/bensmidt/CS229-ML-Autumn-2018/tree/main/Solutions) with my solutions for each problem. Each coding problem in the problem set contains a file (or files) in the "src" directory. The predictions and visualization outputs are located in the "output" directory. For simplicity I've decided to use Google Drive to store my handwritten math solutions since it automatically syncs with GoodNotes (however I may later upload a pdf for each problem set to GitHub since the solutions are concise and the PDFs should be short). 

Below I've linked coding assignment solutions (GitHub) for individual problems and a PDF of math solutions (Google Drive) for each problem set. Page numbers for those PDFs are provided below as well.
